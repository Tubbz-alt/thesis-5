Haskell, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) has been adding
new type-level programming features for some time. Many of these features --
chiefly: generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs), type families, kind
polymorphism, and promoted datatypes -- have brought Haskell to the doorstep
of dependent types. Many dependently typed programs can even currently be
encoded, but often the constructions are painful.

In this dissertation, I describe Dependent Haskell, which supports full
dependent types via a backward-compatible extension to today's Haskell. An
important contribution of this work is an implementation, in GHC, of Dependent
Haskell. The text contains a full description of the differences between
Dependent Haskell and today's Haskell, a type-safe enhanced intermediate
language (called System FCD) supporting dependent types, and a type inference
algorithm with proved soundness and completeness results.
