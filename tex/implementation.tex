\section{Promoting base types}
\label{sec:promoting-base-types}

\begin{proposal}
This chapter will consider any differences between the theory presented
in this dissertation and the actual implementation in GHC. It is possible
that nothing of general interest will fit in this chapter and that it might
be removed.

One possible subject of interest in this section is that the design of
Dependent Haskell appears to require having just one parser for terms,
types, and kinds. This is in stark contrast to today's GHC, which has
three separate parsers.
