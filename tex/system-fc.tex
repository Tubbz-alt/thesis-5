\chapter{System~FC}
\label{cha:system-fc}

\begin{proposal}
This chapter will be a thorough review of System FC as it exists today.
It will be a combination of the systems described in previous
work~\cite{promotion,safe-coercions,closed-type-families}. My chief
goal in writing this chapter is establishing a solid baseline from which
to grow. System FC has gotten big enough that 12-page papers do not have
enough space to fully explain it; all recent treatments have been abbreviated.
This treatment will be unabridged, but it will focus on the theoretical
version of FC, as distinct from the variant that is implemented in GHC.

\section{Type safety proof sketch}

\begin{proposal}
Instead of proving the type safety of System FC, I will draw a very broad
outline. This outline will be filled in with the proof of System FCD, the
version with dependent types.
