Richard A. Eisenberg's Dissertation
===================================

This repo stores all the files for my dissertation. I have decided to put
this work-in-progress in the public domain both to generate interest and
to get feedback. Thus, feedback is assuredly welcome, and feel free to post
Issues.

To build, just use `make`.
