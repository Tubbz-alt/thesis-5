Big question:
  - do I assume committee has read proposal?   Yes. but proceed anyway.

things to cover:
motivating example: glambda
why Haskell
quantifiers
challenges
  - type inference details: proofs, completeness characterization
  - implementation (nec. for claim of "complete enough")
  - expanding shared subset (promoting functions? how? desaturation?)
  - roles
  - erasure
timeline
