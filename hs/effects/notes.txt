- Sometimes need to change argument order because of left to right GADT pattern matching
    Biggest example: handler

- Matchable vs unmatchable arrows

- Searching through the list of effects for a state is troublesome if we
  don't know what type to look for.

- need to manually lift because we don't have implicits (but maybe we should)
