Differences from Gundry's thesis.

- Two arrows
- I support Case analysis on *
- Gundry has lambdas (only at term level) and first-order, always-applied functions
  (shared).
- Gundry includes axioms, but they are only for magical things like commutativity.
  Not for type families.
- Gundry's "Good" is not straightforward to establish. It is *not* syntactic.
- No roles, closed type families
- I have unsaturated functions in types.

- My type erasure property is stronger: his doesn't erase type-lambdas.
- He has a more intricate consistency relation. And his proof is wrong.
  (See email to Adam on May 13.) Of course, his theorem may well be correct,
  but his proof certainly seems wrong.

- Gundry's chapter 8 (p. 185) has many nice examples.

DONE/OMIT:
- DONE I think I'm going to skip non-deterministic elaboration, but instead have
  a type system. Or maybe they're the same thing.
- DNE Only one `case` in the source language
- OLD Gundry parameterizes by a vector while I parameterize by a subst.

- DONE I have two checking judgments, a la VTA (his is Fig 7.9, p. 171)
- DONE But he does have two synth judgments (Fig 7.10, p. 172)
- DONE He does not allow annotated lambda-bound variables, avoiding the weirdness.
- DONE He uses an application judgment like Dunfield/Krishnaswami (Fig 7.12, p. 174)
- DONE His subsumption does not do deep skolemisation. But it does have an equivalent
  of the FunRel / FunIrrel distinction via his phase annotations.

- DONE Gundry uses a new solver (Sec 7.5.1 on p. 175) instead of OutsideIn's.
- OMIT Gundry also considers only simple patterns, just like me. (Sec 7.6, p. 177)
- DONE Gundry does not differentiate between synth and check for case expressions.
- OMIT Gundry adds implicit variables to case patterns with -->> (See Sec 7.6.1, p. 179)
