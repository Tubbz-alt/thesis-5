Differences from Gundry's thesis.

- Two arrows
- I support Case analysis on *
- Gundry has lambdas (only at term level) and first-order, always-applied functions
  (shared).
- Gundry includes axioms, but they are only for magical things like commutativity.
  Not for type families.
- Gundry's "Good" is not straightforward to establish. It is *not* syntactic.
- No roles, closed type families

- I think I'm going to skip non-deterministic elaboration, but instead have
  a type system. Or maybe they're the same thing.
- My source-level type system will be bidirectional
- Only one `case` in the source language
