These ideas for FC simplification are mostly from discussions with
the Sr project students about formalizing FC

- Data constructors should be saturated. This simplifies the presentation
with no loss in expressivity. Anything dealing with "values" is much easier.

- Patterns should just be constructor names, with lambdas on the RHS. Much,
much simpler than the current story.

- The signature elements corresponding to datatypes and data constructors
should be pared down. Currently, they look like (T : k) and (K : t), but
the structure of k and t, respectively, is quite constrained. Instead, just
store the interesting bits, and have the kinding/typing rules extract
these bits and fill out the type. Much easier this way.

- (~) should be a type again. This is a little silly, but it removes several
now-redundant coercion forms.
