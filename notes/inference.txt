- type inference can introduce only unif variables
- unif variables have no relevance annotation
- worker/wrapper for data constructors is built in. You can't directly
  refer to any data constructor worker in Haskell.
- My Haskell patterns (H xs) are simpler than they really should be.
  But it's annoying otherwise.
