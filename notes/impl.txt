Interesting aspects of implementation:

- DONE eqType

We want eqType to be the largest convenient relation that is no larger than ~.
Why? See Note [Non-trivial definitional equality] in TyCoRep. I believe examples
of the nightmare can be found in the pure unifier.

- DONE The pure unifier algorithm. Note [Kind coercions in Unify] in Unify.

- SKIP The asymmetrical ForAllCo. See Note [Forall coercions] in TyCoRep, and think
about the fact that kinds are stored with tyvars. Also about the inefficiency
of mapping over a coercion with this representation.

- SKIP Dropping coercions with -dno-core-lint for efficiency.

- SKIP Related: the quadratic size of coercions with chains of T.F. reduction.
