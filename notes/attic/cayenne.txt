DONE Cayenne requires lambdas to be annotated
Cayenne is abandon-ware
Cayenne has no type classes
DONE Cayenne has a module system
DONE Stratified kind system
DONE No pattern matching on Type
Use # instead of * for the kind of types, due to parsing challenges

"The type part of case expression is only necessary
if the type of the right hand sides depend on the scrutinized
expression."  <-- I'm baffled. Core Cayenne requires an annotation on the
result of every case. EDIT: Oh. No dependent pattern matching.

DONE No specification of where type signatures are necessary.

DONE No proven metatheory.

DONE No coercion assumptions. This means no GADTs or dependent pattern matches.

DONE Makes argument that partial correctness is better than none at all.
Just like my argument.

DONE Cayenne erases all things of type Type. But that's not all that can be
erased sometimes.
